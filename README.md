This is just a simple tool I threw together for myself, as such it only works on windows because I used the pyCaw module to mute the microphone.

Here's a short video of me showing it muting the microphone: https://youtu.be/CyRbX0z1D38

I didn't show it in the video, but you can hold left click and drag to move the indicator.  You can also change the size of the indicator by holding right click and moving your mouse up and down.

Because I've made it windows only I included a batch file to install the libraries I used if people want to use this project for themselves.  Enjoy!
